# RISCV-multi-cycle-processor
This is a multi-cycle processor designed according to the instruction set(assembly language) of RISC-V using the System Verilog HDL.
First of all, let us take a look at the code, and the schematics of the processor's different parts, and then you will see tests simulated and their results:
